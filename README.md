# BibleParsing
The goal of this project is to identify basic grammar in each verse of the Bible and parse semantically equivalent sentences from different languages into their corresponding grammar. Specifically we will first compare Luke 1 in morphological Greek New Testament(mGNT) and New American Standard Bible 1995(NASB1995) as an example. 
The text resources come from blueletterbible.org and biblegateway.com
